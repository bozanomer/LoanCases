# Loan Cases: Paid Off or Not
In this work, I will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.I load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. We used the following algorithms to build our models:

k-Nearest Neighbour
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression
 The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index
F1-score
LogLoss
